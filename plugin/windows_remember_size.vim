" == New version: tries to automatically keep up without whatever layout changes
" you make, by storing an unfocused and focused size for each window. ==
"
" Explanation: Whenever you leave a window, it remembers what size it was, and
" whenever you enter a window, it remembers what size it was before entering.
" Thus it records "focused" and "unfocused" sizes for each window, and it will
" try to grow/shrink windows on entering/leaving, to match the recorded value.
"
" Warning: This system is not perfect, specifically when opening a new window
" (changing the layout) it has no strategy and will often squash the new
" window when it is unfocused (because other windows remember their old sizes,
" so don't leave any space for the new window).
"
" Solution: The best approach appears to be, as soon as your layout breaks in
" some way, fix it immediately with 20<C-W>+ or whatever, to minimize the
" damage (before the new broken values get recorded).  This is a small work
" overhead for the user, which he must exchange for the beneficial features of
" this script!

" TODO: We need :ForgetWidths and :ForgetHeights and :ForgetSizes to disable
" autocmds, so we really can visit every window and forget their w:settings.
" It would be pretty handy sometimes, when the display looks right on this
" window, but old settings are causing trouble on others.
"
" TODO: Do something useful on VimResized event, for example scale all
" remembered sizes proportional to size change, and scale all open windows
" too!  Actually NO to the last bit, and no to scaling TList/MBE/FileExplorer!
" Vim often does what I want to achieve when I enlarge the window, it makes
" the current window grow whilst others stay the same.  Actually TList always
" stays the same width whether it is current window or not.  The only issue is
" height - if the current window is below another then it grows, but if it is
" above another then it doesn't!

" BUGS:
" When we add a new window to the list, e.g. TagList, when switching to it, the old unfocused size of the previous window from the *old* layout is applied.
" I think we need to forget some things when layout changes?  Forget all unfocused sizes?
" Or perhaps when a new window enters the layout, we should quickly grab its dimensions and set those as its focused and unfocused size?

" OK I like this version a lot now.  With the exception of the major bugs, which is when new windows are made, sometimes a window will end up 0 height or 0 width.
" When we are thinking of restoring or saving values, we could check the number of windows (or even their names) to see if any change has occured.
" New windows should be encouraged to take 50% of the space I guess, as per Vim's default.

" Perhaps what we should do is have window remember their relative size rather than their actual size.  Would this be a percentage, or a ratio?
" Then what do we do when a new window is created?  Shrink them all by 10%?  Shrink them intelligently?

"" == Old version: only stores when user changes size with key mapping. ==

" Posterity: This version went through so many refactors, it almost visited
" all possible approaches!  See hwi.ath.cx CVS for those alternative
" strategies/attempts.  But note this final version was the one I thought
" worked best.

" When you set the size of a window (presently using keymaps) it remembers its
" size, and restores to that size the next time you enter it.

" Ideally instead of keymaps would could intercept user-originated calls to
" :resize, e.g. from the mouse or from user or default mappings.
" (There is no WinResized event to attach to.)

" Alternatively, we could try *always* storing the size:
" autocmd WinLeave * call <SID>RememberHeight() | call <SID>RememberWidth()

" BUG: Occasionally I press the restore button and it goes mad.  This might be
" related to me maximizing the window in X.

" I might deprecate this script in favour of:
" Allow setting of layout "strategy", one of which could be:
"   - Divide height 1/3 last window, 2/3rds this window, shrink rest.
"   (Perhaps 3rd last give 1 line, others 0, or 3 and 1.)
"   - Perhaps I even want my windows to cycle for me, so if I am focused on
"   say the bottom one, the 3 above keep getting updated to display the
"   previous 3 buffers I entered.

" CONSIDER TODO: Sometimes the resize rules we set get confused when we create
" a new window (window numbers change).  Perhaps it would feel nicer to
" associate remembered height/width with the buffer, not the window?

" Intercept the normal resize keys:
nnoremap <silent> <C-W>+ <C-W>+:call <SID>RememberHeight()<Enter>

" BUG: ForgetWindowSizes() sometimes changes the current window layout!

" OTOH: Using window-local rather than windowid-indexed vars means they
" disappear tidily when windows are closed or opened.
" Or we could just disable our WinEnter event handler during the windo calls.
" Or we can accept that ForgetWindowSizes might change the current window sizes!
